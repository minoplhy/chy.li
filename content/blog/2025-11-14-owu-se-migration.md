If you are familiar with my site, which presumably not. This isn’t the first time that domain migration has happened, and this is one of them. I always make the hoarding of X (insert stuff here) my biggest priority, as I tend to keep everything online as long as possible. But to **keep things sustainable(AKA Domain Portfolio Healthiness)**, for the foreseeable future. In this wild west of global politics and domain price skyrocketing, this migration has to happen, either now or in the future.

**It's just a matter of when.**

While this may sound concerning for other domain hoarders out there, But don't worry! 

I planned this migration a year ahead from now as `owu.se` will be paid until September, 2026. Roughly 10 months from the time of writing.

**chy.li : chy-li chyli**

When you search `chyli` on your favorite search engine, you will find Cisterna chyli, which is a “dilated sac” located “posterior to the abdominal aorta,” instead of me. I’ve to declare that it has nothing to do with how I sourced this name at all, nor was I aware of this connection prior to registration of the domain. :D

**Now to the migration**, There will be **no email Migration**!!. I'm still using `3qx.nl` as an email portal and has no plan for cancellation of this ever.

Also as a tradition of domain migration, every migration **MUST HAVE** either website UI improvement and/or UI overhaul. But lucky me, I didn’t have time for a complete rewrite this time. So I concluded it with a bit of site improvement/rewrite, and you can already see changes by navigating around my site (chy.li).

# Changes

At the time of writing, I've briefly checked on what migration to perform. Which turn out to be less than [last time](/blog/big-migration-2023), as there is **no UI complete overhaul** this time(there sill is, but not a complete rewrite).

* **Main site**: a big UI improvement(yay) and [contact](/findme) page revival
* **OWU's Sharing Portal**: Discontinued
* **Gitea**: Replace old git remote domain to `chy.li`
* **Hugo Theme**: change submodule url to new one

TODO:

~~* **Blog Post and 7**: Need to change the domain for every blog post~~ DONE

# Action Required!
* **Gitea**: Replace old git remote domain to `chy.li`
* **Hugo Theme**: change submodule url to new one

# Migration Timeline
